# Interactive FDTD
Interactive FDTD is a real-time and interactive playground for the simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation through a user-specified medium. The simulation algorithm is based on the FDTD method. This solver follows the object-oriented design and is implemented in C++ and Qt.
