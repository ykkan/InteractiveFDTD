# Interactive FDTD
## Introduction
This is a dynamic, interactive GUI programm for simulating 2D electromagnetic scattering problem. The core algorithm
implemented in this programm is finite difference time domain method (FDTD), which discretize the Maxwell's equation in
both spatial and time domain. This program use c++ QT and QCustomplot.
